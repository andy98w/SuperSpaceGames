SUPER SPACE GAMES are a series of iOS applications developed by Andy Wu in 2020. These applications are to be run on iOS devices. Summary of each of these files:

SunEarthMoon: Simple solar system with 3 astronomical bodies, no user interaction. First test for a game made.

ChaoticSolarSystem: User input includes rotating their device and pressing a button to shoot down asteroids raining down on Earth.

HotGasChamber: Simulates thermodynamics including area and pressure. Users may slide a bar to increase speed of moving particles inside a room.

SuperSpaceMan: Like doodle jump, user will rotate their phone to control a character to bounce on objects and achieve a high score, while shooting down asteroids along the way.

SolarSystem: The more advanced version of SunEarthMoon that has more planets and other astronomical bodies such as comets and asteroids. No user interaction.

HeatThermal: Users will control a temperature meter that will increase speed of particles in a room.
